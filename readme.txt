To patch X-Wing Alliance, copy the .bat and xwahacker.exe files into the
X-Wing Alliance installation directory (the one that contains
xwingalliance.exe).
Then run the appropriate .bat file to apply or revert a patch.
Only version 2.02 of xwingalliance.exe is supported.
If you are running Windows Vista (R), you may have to choose
"Run as Administrator" or in some other way work around UAC restrictions.

The file otherfixes.txt contains patch instructions for other
games like TIE95, XWing95 and X-Wing vs. TIE/Balance of Power.
