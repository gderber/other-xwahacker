xwareplacer will read a file called xwareplacer-list.txt.
Each time XWing Alliance writes a new temp.tie file it will
replace it with a file given in xwareplacer-list.txt and then
moves on to the next entry.
Like this you should be able to play a whole campaign without
having to switch out of the game.
To use it, you must copy xwareplacer.exe to the folder containing
XWINGALLIANCE.EXE and run it from there after creating a suitable
xwareplacer-list.txt.
The xwareplacer-list.txt might look like this for playing the solo
campaign from http://amiralaria.free.fr/xwam_an.php :
